# Socket Programming - Basics

This repository demonstrates a basic implementation of **socket programming** in Python. 

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **Socket creation**: Setting up a socket to communicate over a network.
- **IP resolution**: Resolving the IP address of a given domain name (in this case, Google).
- **Establishing a connection**: Connecting to a remote server (Google) via the resolved IP address and a specified port.

## Requirements:
- Python (version 3 or above)


This simple demonstration helps to understand the fundamental concepts of socket programming. You can modify and extend this implementation for more complex network communications.
